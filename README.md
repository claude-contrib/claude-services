# Claude Services

> Production-ready MCP servers for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — give Claude the tools to browse, read, write, and reason beyond its defaults.

MCP servers extend what Claude can *do* — not just what it knows. Install a service and Claude gains new capabilities it can use autonomously: controlling a real browser, reading and writing files, structuring its reasoning step by step.

## How Services Work

Each service is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that Claude Code connects to as an external process. Once installed, Claude picks up the new tools automatically — no extra prompting required.

## Quickstart

**1. Register the marketplace** in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "claude-services": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "claude-contrib/claude-services"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Install a service** inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin install playwright@claude-services
```

Claude now has browser automation tools available in every session.

## Available Services

| Service | Description | Tools unlocked |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [`thinking`](plugins/thinking/README.md) | Sequential thinking for structured problem analysis | Break down complex problems step by step before acting |
| [`filesystem`](plugins/filesystem/README.md) | Filesystem access beyond the working directory | Read, write, and navigate files across your system |
| [`playwright`](plugins/playwright/README.md) | Full browser automation via Playwright | Navigate pages, click, fill forms, take screenshots |

## Publish Your Own Service

Have an MCP server your team relies on? Package it for one-command install:

```

├── .mcp.json                    # server command + args
└── README.md                   # what it unlocks + install instructions
```

1. **Fork** this repo and drop your plugin under `plugins/`
